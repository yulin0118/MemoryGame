*As the user comes into the website, he is invited to look over an overview of the rules in a sub-page, which also includes some tips, a fun musical challenge, and a link back to the main page.*

*Before the user starts the game, he can pick one out of three difficulty levels; the `clock` and `oopsie count` updates accordingly as he clicks `start`, which becomes `stop` when game is in session.* 

*When a button is pressed, a picture of the musical note corresponding the pitch played lights up.*

*As the user makes progress, the game speeds up each turn. With every correct sequence guessed, the progress bar updates to reflect current status. The `clock` turns pink when there are 3 seconds left; the user loses the game if timer runs out before he completes his guess correctly.*

*The `oopsie count` turns pink when no more mistakes are allowed, game ends once user reaches mistake limit.*
