    <h2> How To Play</h2>

    <p>

  <h2> Tips</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>To help your memory, when each botton is played, 
        you will see the musical note that matches its pitch.</li>
      <li>The game speeds up as you get closer to victory, try to remember the 
      first couple of notes in the beginning so you have less to worry about later. </li>
      <li>If you make a mistake in a sequence, do not restart the sequence, finish from where you left off. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h2> A Little Challenge</h2>


  <p>Before you click start, play the sequence [green, green, purple, purple, tan, tan, purple],
      can you make out what song you just played? Can you try to finish that song?</p>
